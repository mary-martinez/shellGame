## The Golden Rule: 

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) Make HTML with 3 buttons and a score keeper
2) Put image directly into HTML
3) Import functions into app.js and grab DOM elements
4) Initialize state for shell hiding places, correct guesses, and total guesses
5) Set up event listeners for button clicks
6) Create function to handle the guess that updates the view with the location of the ball plus the updated score keeper
7) Create a ball in CSS file to be displayed at the correct location
8) Finalize any other styling

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
